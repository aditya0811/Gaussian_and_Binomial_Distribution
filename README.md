# Gaussian_and_Binomial_Distribution

This project contains a python package [vzerodotoneDistribution](https://pypi.org/project/vzerodotoneDistribution/) than can used to find gaussian and binomial distribution for a given data. It also has functions that can be used to plot bar chart, probability distribution function for the required data.
I have used various concepts of Object Oriented Programming like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism(Operator Overloading) for this project.

You can use following command to install this package into your system using python [pip manager](https://pypi.org/project/pip-manager/)

```
pip install vzerodotoneDistribution
```
